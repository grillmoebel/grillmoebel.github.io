Die Überschriftensuche gestaltet sich als schwierig, nicht weil jene ein bestimmte Essenz von etwas verkörpern sollte; vielmehr eignen sich hierfür, wo es um Lemmy Kilmisters Tod geht, dementsprechend zahlreiche Aussprüche. Und genau deshalb folgt nun der beste aller Nachrufe. Denn das, was von Lemmy weiterleben sollte, erschöpft sich nicht in alberner Rock'n'Roll-Heroisierung. Der Typ braucht niemanden, der auch noch so sinnvolle Dinge über ihn schreibt und ihn damit der langweiligen öffentlichen Gedenkindustrie anheim bringt. Grillmöbel tut das, was wie immer niemand tut und sagt: lassen wir ihm selbst das Wort, das kann er nämlich ziemlich gut. <br>
„
They take your money, break your soul,
They say it's only rock 'n' roll,
They think they're cool to wheel and deal,
Without a thought to how we feel,
They pick you up and drop you flat,
Then tell you life can be like that,
You blew it all the day you signed,
Your stupid name on some dotted line,
We hate the men, who make the rules,
The ones who always try so hard to make us look like Fools!“(1976)<br>
„
Don't need no time for prayer
Don't save no knee-pads for me up there
If your head's alright, ya don't need binoculars to see the light
Ya don't need no miracle vision
Bet ya life I don't need religion.

I don't need no Santa Claus
Don't believe in fairies no more
Don't need to go to confession
I'm already trying to fight depression
Don't need no exorcism
Bet ya life I don't need religion.“(1982)<br>
„You might be a financial wizard,
With a sack of loot,
All I see is a slimy lizard,
With an expensive suit
Go on and run your corporation,
Go and kiss some ass,
You might buy half of the nation,
But you can't buy class
You bastards think it's funny,
Lyin' and thieving all your life,
Think all there is is money,
Got your future strapped up tight,
Just 'Cos You Got The Power,
That don't mean you got the right“ (1987)<br>
„I tell you we are doomed my friends
Our time is come, our time is come
We live within a charnel house
Rotten to the core
We glorify lust, greed & pain
We drown our hope in poison rain
We point the finger, shift the blame
Ambition makes us whores

March or croak, march or croak
All your lives a cosmic joke
Fill your days with piss and smoke
The wolf waits at your door

Burn and dance, burn and dance
Sex, death, torture, false romance
Whoop and howl, you have no chance
Burn & rise no more“(1992)<br>
„Don't chase after money, you are gonna lose your soul,
Same for religion, out of control,
Don't fall for money, or heroine again,
Needles for your enemies, bullshit for your friends,
The way we're going, same as we came,
Bought the fucking picture and we're playing for the frame.
Everybody asking you when they gonna die,
I think that they should be askin' why.“(1995)<br>
„You will never sorrow for your friends
You will never miss them for a day
You will be a hero, you will be a king
Get into the money, get into the swing

Politicians eat your words
Prohibition that's a joke
You can't fool everybody, you should be ashamed

You can take the money,
but can you take the blame
You can take the money,
but can you take the blame

See you on TV, you talk and talk and talk
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Liars, thieves and dorks
You may be in control,
so how come you're so scared
Is it because you feel, the hatred everywhere,
the hatred everywhere“(1998)<br>
„The government is coming and it wants to be your friend,
It wants to show you how to be a snitch
Inform upon your children, the inevitable end,
Is everyone's a victim but the filthy fucking rich,
And religion, like the monster that it is
Keeps telling you to turn the other cheek
God is on your side, but I don't think that you're on his,
If Jesus showed up now he'd be in jail by next week“ (2002)<br>
„Soldier, soldier, see where we were,
You have to know the story,
Older, colder, life isn't fair,
Got to grab the sword of glory.
If you can't see what bloody fools we were,
Then you were also born a bloody fool,
Listen to the hundred million dead,
They didn't know it, but they died for you“(2006)<br>
„Stuck here ten thousand years, don't know how to act,
Everything forgotten, specially the facts.
The way we live is running scared; I don't like it much,
All things come to he who waits but these days most things suck.

We are the chosen ones, we don't know right from wrong,
We don't know what's going on, don't know enough to care.
We are the dogs of war; don't even know what for,
But we obey the law, get back in line.“(2010)<br>
„
Standing by the ocean
Wishing I could swim
Wishing that the future
Didn't look so grim

All the greedy people
Know what's good to get
Never liked a liar
That's all we ever get
Know what you think
Know what you've seen
Half the world is psycho
The other half is mean

And silence rules
So we approve the crime
Scratching through the garbage
At the end of time“(2013)<br><br>
