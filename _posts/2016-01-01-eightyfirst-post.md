Die Überschriftensuche gestaltet sich als schwierig, nicht weil jene ein bestimmte Essenz von etwas verkörpern sollte; vielmehr eignen sich hierfür, wo es um Lemmy Kilmisters Tod geht, dementsprechend zahlreiche Aussprüche. Und genau deshalb folgt nun der beste aller Nachrufe. Denn das, was von Lemmy weiterleben sollte, erschöpft sich nicht in alberner Rock'n'Roll-Heroisierung. Der Typ braucht niemanden, der auch noch so sinnvolle Dinge über ihn schreibt und ihn damit der langweiligen öffentlichen Gedenkindustrie anheim bringt. Grillmöbel tut das, was wie immer niemand tut und sagt: lassen wir ihm selbst das Wort, das kann er nämlich ziemlich gut. <br><br>
„
They take your money, break your soul,<br>
They say it's only rock 'n' roll,<br>
They think they're cool to wheel and deal,<br>
Without a thought to how we feel,<br>
They pick you up and drop you flat,<br>
Then tell you life can be like that,<br>
You blew it all the day you signed,<br>
Your stupid name on some dotted line,<br>
We hate the men, who make the rules,<br>
The ones who always try so hard to make us look like Fools!“(1976)<br><br>
„
Don't need no time for prayer<br>
Don't save no knee-pads for me up there<br>
If your head's alright, ya don't need binoculars to see the light<br>
Ya don't need no miracle vision<br>
Bet ya life I don't need religion.<br>
I don't need no Santa Claus<br>
Don't believe in fairies no more<br>
Don't need to go to confession<br>
I'm already trying to fight depression<br>
Don't need no exorcism<br>
Bet ya life I don't need religion.“(1982)<br><br>
„You might be a financial wizard,<br>
With a sack of loot,<br>
All I see is a slimy lizard,<br>
With an expensive suit<br>
Go on and run your corporation,<br>
Go and kiss some ass,<br>
You might buy half of the nation,<br>
But you can't buy class<br>
You bastards think it's funny,<br>
Lyin' and thieving all your life,<br>
Think all there is is money,<br>
Got your future strapped up tight,<br>
Just 'Cos You Got The Power,<br>
That don't mean you got the right“ (1987)<br><br>
„I tell you we are doomed my friends<br>
Our time is come, our time is come<br>
We live within a charnel house<br>
Rotten to the core<br>
We glorify lust, greed & pain<br>
We drown our hope in poison rain<br>
We point the finger, shift the blame<br>
Ambition makes us whores<br>
March or croak, march or croak<br>
All your lives a cosmic joke<br>
Fill your days with piss and smoke<br>
The wolf waits at your door<br>
Burn and dance, burn and dance<br>
Sex, death, torture, false romance<br>
Whoop and howl, you have no chance<br>
Burn & rise no more“(1992)<br><br>
„Don't chase after money, you are gonna lose your soul,<br>
Same for religion, out of control,<br>
Don't fall for money, or heroine again,<br>
Needles for your enemies, bullshit for your friends,<br>
The way we're going, same as we came,<br>
Bought the fucking picture and we're playing for the frame.<br>
Everybody asking you when they gonna die,<br>
I think that they should be askin' why.“(1995)<br><br>
„You will never sorrow for your friends<br>
You will never miss them for a day<br>
You will be a hero, you will be a king<br>
Get into the money, get into the swing<br>
Politicians eat your words<br>
Prohibition that's a joke<br>
You can't fool everybody, you should be ashamed<br>
You can take the money,<br>
but can you take the blame<br>
You can take the money,<br>
but can you take the blame<br>
See you on TV, you talk and talk and talk<br>
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah<br>
Liars, thieves and dorks<br>
You may be in control,<br>
so how come you're so scared<br>
Is it because you feel, the hatred everywhere,<br>
the hatred everywhere“(1998)<br><br>
„The government is coming and it wants to be your friend,<br>
It wants to show you how to be a snitch<br>
Inform upon your children, the inevitable end,<br>
Is everyone's a victim but the filthy fucking rich,<br>
And religion, like the monster that it is<br>
Keeps telling you to turn the other cheek<br>
God is on your side, but I don't think that you're on his,<br>
If Jesus showed up now he'd be in jail by next week“ (2002)<br><br>
„Soldier, soldier, see where we were,<br>
You have to know the story,<br>
Older, colder, life isn't fair,<br>
Got to grab the sword of glory.<br>
If you can't see what bloody fools we were,<br>
Then you were also born a bloody fool,<br>
Listen to the hundred million dead,<br>
They didn't know it, but they died for you“(2006)<br><br>
„Stuck here ten thousand years, don't know how to act,<br>
Everything forgotten, specially the facts.<br>
The way we live is running scared; I don't like it much,<br>
All things come to he who waits but these days most things suck.<br>
We are the chosen ones, we don't know right from wrong,<br>
We don't know what's going on, don't know enough to care.<br>
We are the dogs of war; don't even know what for,<br>
But we obey the law, get back in line.“(2010)<br><br>
„Standing by the ocean<br>
Wishing I could swim<br>
Wishing that the future<br>
Didn't look so grim<br>
All the greedy people<br>
Know what's good to get<br>
Never liked a liar<br>
That's all we ever get<br>
Know what you think<br>
Know what you've seen<br>
Half the world is psycho<br>
The other half is mean<br>
And silence rules<br>
So we approve the crime<br>
Scratching through the garbage<br>
At the end of time“(2013)<br><br>
